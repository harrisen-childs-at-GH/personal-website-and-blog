## Introduction
### Hey there ðŸ‘‹. My name is Harrisen Childs, I am a software engineer based in the KC metro area and I am working on a personal website. This is still a WIP but the plan is to spend about 30 minutes to an hour a day making myself a personal website to use as a resume/landing page for all things me.

## Planned Technologies:
### I plan to use all sorts of technologies/plug-ins to create and host this personal website including: 

- Ruby on Rails
- Tailwind CSS
- Heroku Deployment
- Dry Gems & Methodologies
